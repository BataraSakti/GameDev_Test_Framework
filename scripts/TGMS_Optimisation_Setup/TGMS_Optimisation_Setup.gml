	    *************
    
	    Calling "TweenSystemOptimise(true)" will enable optimisations if available for targeted platform.
	    As of this time, only YYC targets are affected by the optimisations.
    
	    PLEASE BE AWARE that if you enable optimisations, you MUST update:
	    TGMS_Optimised_Ease() TGMS_Optimised_PSet() TGMS_Optimised_PSetExt()
    
	    These scripts must supply all appropriate ease algorithms
	    and property setters which are required by your application.
    
	    The standard ease algorithms and property setters are already
	    supplied for you. Please add custom additions below the
	    cases already supplied in the switch statements.
    
	    PLEASE BACK UP ALL CUSTOM CASES after extending
	    the optimsation path. Updating TweenGMS in the future will
	    likely replace any custom additions added. If you back
	    up your switch cases, they can easily be placed back into
	    the appropriate switch statements after updating.
